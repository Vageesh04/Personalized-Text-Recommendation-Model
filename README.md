# Personalized-Text-Recommendation-Model
The above code is an attempt to simulate the architecture of Federated Learning. A technique first used by google to maintain data privacy. In this technique the model gets trained without the data ever leaving the user's device. The code simulates the architecture by creating a server, clients, training the model and then implementing it to predict the next word for a text prediction model using RNN.
